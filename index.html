        <h2>Jupiter</h2>
        <p>
          Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and the fifth from
          the Sun. It is a gas giant mostly made of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter
          has a giant storm called the Great Red Spot, which has lasted for
          centuries, and it has at least 90 known moons.

        <h2>Uranus</h2>
        <p>
          Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is known for its pale
          blue-green color, caused by methane in its atmosphere. Unlike other
          planets, Uranus rotates on its side, making its seasons extreme. It is
          an ice giant with rings and at least 27 known moons.

        <h2>Black hole</h2>
        <p>
          A black hole is a place in space where gravity is so strong that
          nothing, not even light, can escape. Most black holes form when
          massive stars collapse. They can grow larger by pulling in gas, stars,
          or even other black holes, and they remain one of spaceâ€™s greatest
          mysteries.
